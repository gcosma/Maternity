I am told that the new policy is not in place. The concern remains that no date has been set for its implementation. 5. Counselling for mothers at increased risk of shoulder dystocia I have not seen any indication that all mothers identified to have an increased chance of shoulder dystocia now receive counselling regarding the risks and benefits associated with vaginal birth or CS. Assisting mothers to understand the implications of risks they face is fundamental to supporting them to make fully informed decisions, in accordance with Montgomery. <span style="background-color:#FFECB3; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Fragmented care

Keywords: factors">It was acknowledged in evidence that parents often want a steer as to the best/safest course of action and that may require medical professionals to express opinions as to the weight to be placed on different risk factors.</span> In some cases, parents may prefer to rely on the viewpoint of an experienced medical professional. It seems that medical professionals do not feel they can offer this assistance as it might be interpreted as trying to impose their opinion on the parent. <span style="background-color:#E1F5FE; border:1px solid #666; border-radius:2px; padding:1px 2px;" title="Theme: House of Commons_Guidance gaps + I-SIRch_Organisation - National and/or local guidance + I-SIRch_Person - Patient (characteristics and performance) - Characteristics - Training and education (e.g., attendance at ante-natal classes)
